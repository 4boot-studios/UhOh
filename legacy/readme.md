# This is the directory contain the source code of legacy versions of SystemMELTDOWN, called Nitrogen (Discord Nitro Generator).

This is the base source code, you will have to rewrite it into C++ or another language yourself. Or if you "compile" you will need to find a way to "compile" it. 

# Feel free to download the source code and contribute!

Nitrogen is based on some part of NoEscape.exe of Endermanch. And I have spent more than 1 hour to rewrite it into C++ :)
